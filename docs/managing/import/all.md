# (Generic) Import

Using {menu}`File -> Import -> Import...`, you can import any file that is
compatible with the LilyPond import tools (musicxml2ly, midi2ly and abc2ly). For
each tool and dialog see [](musicxml.md), [](midi.md) and [](abc.md).

*Note that the specific importer is determined with the help of the file extension
(.xml, .mxl, .midi, .mid or .abc) and without that the importer will fail.
If you get a file type error use the specific importer directly from the menu.*
