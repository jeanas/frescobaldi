# Sessions

A session is basically a list of open files. At any time you can choose
{menu}`Session` or {menu}`Session -> New` and save the current list of open
files to a named session.

Available sessions are accessible through the {menu}`Session` menu.  When you
switch sessions, all current documents are closed first and then the documents
of the other session are opened.

Inside the session properties dialog, you can specify a default directory for
the session.  You can also choose whether to always save the list of open
documents to that session, or to only save on creation (or via {menu}`Session ->
Save`). This can be useful if you want to keep the list of documents in session
the same, even if you open or close documents while working.

Another way of backing up the state of the session is to use the import and
export functionality in the session manager ({menu}`Session -> Save`).  In the
session manager you can also add, edit or remove a session.

Sessions can be grouped in the {menu}`Session` menu by prepending a group name
to the session name, separated by a slash.
