# Importing and exporting snippets

Snippets can be imported from and exported to XML files.

To export snippets, either select them in the snippet manager, or filter the
snippets using the search bar and select none, so that all the snippets visible
in the snippet manager are exported. Export the snippets by selecting
{menu}`Menu -> Export...`, and then choose a file name, preferably ending in
`.xml`.

To import snippets, select {menu}`Menu -> Import...` and choose the file you
want to import. You may also drop an XML file on the snippet manager. A dialog
will be displayed where you can select which snippets you want to import.

The XML format of the snippet library files is simple and documented inside
the XML file.
