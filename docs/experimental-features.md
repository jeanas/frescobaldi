# Experimental Features

Some features of Frescobaldi are in development for quite some time before they
are considered ready for general use. To be able to take advantage of those
features, knowing their limitations, you can select the option *Enable
Experimental Features*, in the [General Preferences](/preferences/general.md).

In most cases you need to restart Frescobaldi or create a new window (via
{menu}`Window -> New Window`) to see the new menu options.

This is the list of experimental features in Frescobaldi:

* {menu}`File -> Export -> Export Audio...`: Export audio (converts MIDI to WAV)

* {menu}`File -> Export -> Export MusicXML...`: Convert LilyPond source to
  MusicXML (without using LilyPond)

* {menu}`Tools -> Object Editor`: Edit properties of objects in LilyPond output

* Editing items in the SVG view
